# Warp Checkers
Warp Checkers is a game created by myself and my friend Bren back in 2018, with the goal of turning the original game of Checkers into something more fun and exciting. The result was an overcomplicated mess, but one that we loved.

The Unity version of Warp Checkers is still a work-in-progress, but the current version of the game can be found at this repository. This section of the readme will be updated when it is complete. My intention is for the finished game to be hosted and embedded online for anybody to play.

I also intend to update this readme with the full list of rules once I have put more time into polishing them. As things currently stand, the game is just a bit too unbalanced.

Thank you for checking it out!
